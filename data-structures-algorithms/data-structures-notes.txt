--- Arrays ---
+> Direct indexing -> fast access when you know the index
+> Easy to create and use

-> Poor searching
-> Poor at inserting and deleting


--- Linked Lists ---
+> Good at adding and deleting items

-> Poor direct access -> needs to iterate the list
-> Poor in searching and sorting


--- Stacks and Queues ---
+> LIFO / FIFO

-> direct access
-> searching and sorting


--- HashTables ---
+> insert and deleting
+> fast access

-> a little more space in memory
-> a little more processing
-> searhing for specific value


--- Sets ---
+> checking membership
+> avoid duplicates

-> bad at everything else


--- Binary Search Trees ---
+> fast insert, delete, access
+> maintaining sorted order

-> take some overhead to create and manage
