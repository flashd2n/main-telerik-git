## Task 3

Create a jQuery plugin that accepts a list of lists and when called on a container element, creates list views for every list inside the container element. 
The results should look like **[that](https://rawgit.com/TelerikAcademy/JavaScript-UI-and-DOM/master/Topics/09.%20jQuery%20Plugins/homework/task-3/result/index.html)**.

- Implement add item functionality for every list.
- Implement drag and drop functionality for list items - when a list item is dragged and dropped on top of another list, the item should be moved to the other list.
- Play around with the **[example](https://rawgit.com/TelerikAcademy/JavaScript-UI-and-DOM/master/Topics/09.%20jQuery%20Plugins/homework/task-3/result/index.html)** to get a better understanding of the task.
