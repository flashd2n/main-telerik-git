Bugs:

#1 Fileologger not loggin error, because the code in error method was commented
#2 Startup could not create engine, because the logger was passed as a string
#3 Cannot create user, because not createuser option in commands factory
#4 Modelsfactory create use method couldn't create a user, because the username and email parameters were swapped
#5 Task didn't display the owner of the task

Bottleneck:

#1 Buildcommand in CommandsFactory has an unneccesary while loop and the for loop was also totally unneccessary
